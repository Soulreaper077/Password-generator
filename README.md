# Password-generator
this is the challenge for module 3, we were instructed to make a password generator that can produce a random password from 8-128 characters. we also had to ask the user for parameters in the password that they would either have to add or remove. the criteria for the password included uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers.
